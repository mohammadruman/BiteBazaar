in app .js  the root of the application and we have to provide store to our 
so we need a provider the appstore 
so 
in app.js 
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import appstore from "../utils/appstore";
import {provider} from react
 <Provider store={appstore}>
        <div className="App">
            <Header/>
            <Outlet/>
            <Footer/>
             </div>
        </Provider>


        so now lets create the slice for the store 
- create a another file in utils 
 *again this create slice come from a reduxjs toolkit because it is something that is realted to redux

 and this function takes a configuration to create a slice 

 import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cardslice = createSlice({
    name:cart
})
